# ⏰ Digital Timer with Alarm Functionality

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Digital Timer** project simulates a **personal alarm clock** using an embedded system platform. It allows users to set alarms with flexible configurations such as **daily, weekly, or specific-day alarms**. The system uses **timers**, **interrupts**, and various **peripherals** to provide an interactive and functional alarm system.

The focus is to create a user-friendly interface using components like:
- **LCD display** for showing time and menu options,
- **I2C-based RTC** for accurate real-time tracking,
- **Digital keypad** for user inputs,
- **LEDs** to indicate system status or alarm.
